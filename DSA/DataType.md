In Java, you write **f** (or **F**) after a number to explicitly specify that the value is a **float** type; otherwise, Java treats decimal numbers as **double** by default[1][4][7][9].

For example:

- float x = 3.5f;
- double y = 3.5;

If you write `float x = 3.5;`, the compiler will show an error because **3.5** is treated as a double literal, and assigning a double value directly to a float variable without explicit casting is not allowed due to precision loss[5][8]. Adding the **f** tells the compiler that the literal should be interpreted as a float, which is necessary because float has less precision and a smaller range than double.
