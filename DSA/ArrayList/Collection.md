`import java.util.Collections;` is a Java statement that imports the `Collections` class from the `java.util` package.

### Purpose of `Collections`

The `Collections` class provides utility methods for working with collections (e.g., lists, sets, and maps). It includes methods for sorting, searching, shuffling, reversing, and synchronizing collections.

### Common Methods in `Collections`

Here are some useful methods from `Collections`:

- `Collections.sort(list)`: Sorts a list in ascending order.
- `Collections.reverse(list)`: Reverses the order of elements in a list.
- `Collections.shuffle(list)`: Randomly shuffles elements in a list.
- `Collections.max(collection)`: Returns the maximum element.
- `Collections.min(collection)`: Returns the minimum element.
- `Collections.binarySearch(list, key)`: Searches for a key in a sorted list.
- `Collections.unmodifiableList(list)`: Returns an unmodifiable (read-only) version of the list.
