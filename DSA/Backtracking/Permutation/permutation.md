### **Permutation (in short)**

A **permutation** is an arrangement or ordering of all elements of a set.
In DSA, permutation means generating or checking all possible orderings of elements in a sequence.

**Example:**
For array `[1, 2, 3]`, possible permutations are:
`[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]`.
