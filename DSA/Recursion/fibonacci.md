Ah, I see ðŸ˜ƒ Youâ€™re asking **why the output of `fib(6)` is 8**, not about the call count formula.
Letâ€™s go back to the basics and carefully evaluate it.

### Fibonacci definition

Your function defines Fibonacci as:

- `fib(0) = 0`
- `fib(1) = 1`
- For `n > 1`: `fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)`

So the sequence builds up like this:

```
fib(0) = 0
fib(1) = 1
fib(2) = fib(1) + fib(0) = 1 + 0 = 1
fib(3) = fib(2) + fib(1) = 1 + 1 = 2
fib(4) = fib(3) + fib(2) = 2 + 1 = 3
fib(5) = fib(4) + fib(3) = 3 + 2 = 5
fib(6) = fib(5) + fib(4) = 5 + 3 = 8  âœ…
```

### So the sequence is:

```
n:    0  1  2  3  4  5  6
fib:  0  1  1  2  3  5  8
```

---

âœ… Thatâ€™s why `fib(6)` prints **8**.

Would you like me to also draw a **step-by-step recursion tree** that shows exactly how the program reaches `8` during execution?
