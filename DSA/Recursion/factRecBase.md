Great question ðŸ‘Œ â€” you want to know **how the recursion stops execution** in your factorial code.

---

### Key idea:

Every recursive function **must have a stopping condition (base case)**, otherwise it would keep calling itself forever and cause a **StackOverflowError**.

In your code:

```java
if (n == 0) {
    return 1;   // base case
}
```

This line **stops further recursive calls**.

### Step-by-step for `n = 4`

1. `fact(4)` â†’ calls `fact(3)`
2. `fact(3)` â†’ calls `fact(2)`
3. `fact(2)` â†’ calls `fact(1)`
4. `fact(1)` â†’ calls `fact(0)`
5. **fact(0) hits the base case** â†’ returns `1`

Now recursion **doesnâ€™t go deeper**, instead it starts returning back up the call stack:

- `fact(1)` returns `1 * 1 = 1`
- `fact(2)` returns `2 * 1 = 2`
- `fact(3)` returns `3 * 2 = 6`
- `fact(4)` returns `4 * 6 = 24`

Finally, program ends after printing `24`.

---

### In short:

- **Recursive calls keep going down** until `n == 0`.
- When base case is hit, recursion **stops** making new calls.
- Then the program **unwinds the stack** (returns results step by step).
- After the last return (`fact(4)`), no more work remains, so **execution ends**.

âš¡ Think of it like climbing down stairs (calls) until you reach the ground floor (base case). Once at ground floor, you climb back up (returning values) until youâ€™re out of the building (program finishes).

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also explain with a **visual diagram of the call stack** so you can literally see how it stops?
