Perfect! Let’s go step by step into **Memoization (Top-down DP)** – one of the most powerful recursion optimizations. 🚀

## 🧠 **What is Memoization?**

- **Memoization** = **Remembering results of previous computations**.
- Instead of recalculating the same thing multiple times in recursion, we **store the answer** in a cache/array/map.
- Next time we need it → we just **return from memory** (fast!).

👉 This turns **exponential recursion (`O(2^n)`)** into **linear (`O(n)`)**.

## 🔹 Example 1: Fibonacci (Naive vs Memoization)

### ❌ Naive Recursion

```java
int fib(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
```

- Calls `fib(n-1)` and `fib(n-2)` every time
- Many **repeated subproblems** → `O(2^n)`

---

### ✅ With Memoization (Top-Down DP)

```java
int[] dp = new int[1000];  // cache array, initialized with 0

int fib(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;

    if (dp[n] != 0) return dp[n];  // already computed → return

    dp[n] = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);  // compute and store
    return dp[n];
}
```

- Each value of `fib(k)` is computed **once** and stored
- Later calls reuse it instantly

📊 **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
📊 **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` (recursion + dp array)

## 🔹 Example 2: Factorial with Memoization

Although factorial doesn’t need it, just for clarity:

```java
int[] dp = new int[1000];

int fact(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;

    if (dp[n] != 0) return dp[n];

    dp[n] = n * fact(n - 1);
    return dp[n];
}
```

## 💡 Memoization vs Normal Recursion

- Normal recursion → recomputes subproblems many times.
- Memoization → **stores and reuses answers**.

👉 If recursion has **overlapping subproblems**, memoization helps.
👉 This is why it’s used in **Dynamic Programming (DP)**.
