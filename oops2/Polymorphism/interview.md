Here’s a list of interview questions on **Polymorphism** that are commonly asked by top MNCs:

---

### **Conceptual Questions**

1. **What is polymorphism in Java, and why is it important?**
2. **Differentiate between compile-time and runtime polymorphism.**
3. **How does polymorphism improve code reusability and flexibility?**
4. **Can polymorphism be achieved without inheritance in Java? Why or why not?**
5. **What is the role of the `@Override` annotation in achieving polymorphism?**
6. **What is dynamic method dispatch in Java, and how is it related to runtime polymorphism?**
7. **How does the JVM determine the method to invoke during runtime polymorphism?**
8. **Can polymorphism be applied to static methods in Java? Explain why or why not.**
9. **Explain the relationship between polymorphism and interfaces in Java.**
10. **Why can’t a private or final method participate in runtime polymorphism?**

---

### **Practical and Code-Based Questions**

1. **Write a program to demonstrate both compile-time and runtime polymorphism.**
2. **What will happen if a superclass method is called on a subclass object without overriding?**
   Example:

   ```java
   class Parent {
       void show() {
           System.out.println("Parent method");
       }
   }

   class Child extends Parent {}

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Parent obj = new Child();
           obj.show();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **What is the output of the following code snippet?**

   ```java
   class Animal {
       void sound() {
           System.out.println("Animal sound");
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       void sound() {
           System.out.println("Dog barks");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Animal a = new Dog();
           a.sound();
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Can polymorphism be achieved with constructors? Why or why not?**
5. **Demonstrate polymorphism using interfaces in a multi-level inheritance hierarchy.**
6. **Explain and provide an example of how polymorphism is used in Java Collections Framework.**
7. **What happens if you cast a subclass object to a superclass type? Does polymorphism still work?**
   Example:

   ```java
   class A {
       void display() {
           System.out.println("Class A");
       }
   }

   class B extends A {
       void display() {
           System.out.println("Class B");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           A obj = new B();
           obj.display();
       }
   }
   ```

### **Advanced Questions**

1. **How does polymorphism affect memory and performance?**
2. **Can polymorphism be applied to return types? Explain with an example.**
3. **What is the significance of the `instanceof` operator in polymorphism? Provide a use case.**
4. **How does polymorphism work with abstract classes? Give a real-world example.**
5. **Explain how runtime polymorphism is implemented internally in the JVM.**
6. **What are the limitations of polymorphism in Java?**
7. **How does polymorphism support the Open-Closed Principle in SOLID design principles?**
8. **Explain method hiding in the context of polymorphism. Can static methods be overridden?**
   Example:

   ```java
   class Parent {
       static void display() {
           System.out.println("Static Parent");
       }
   }

   class Child extends Parent {
       static void display() {
           System.out.println("Static Child");
       }
   }

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Parent obj = new Child();
           obj.display();
       }
   }
   ```

### **Scenario-Based Questions**

1. **Describe a real-world scenario where polymorphism can simplify code maintenance.**
2. **If a method in a subclass throws a checked exception that is not declared in the superclass method, will polymorphism still work?**
3. **How does polymorphism help in designing loosely coupled systems?**
4. **Can a reference variable of type `Object` demonstrate polymorphism? Provide an example.**
5. **In a project, how would you decide between using polymorphism with interfaces or abstract classes?**

---

### **Behavioral Questions**

1. **Describe a situation in a project where you effectively used polymorphism to solve a problem.**
2. **Have you encountered a scenario where polymorphism caused unexpected behavior or bugs? How did you resolve it?**
